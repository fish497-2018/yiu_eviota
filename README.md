# yiu_eviota

## data: 
morph <- cleaned_data
*contains all the morphology data on variable characters in E. atriventris, mostly relating to the pelvic fins. 

file <- morphology_numerical_data3.csv
*contains cleaned data with eviota locality, with extra columns removed for simplicity for pca analysis

these data sets contain some overlapping information. the major columns of data are e. atriventris locality, pelvic length ratio, number of branches on the 

Question: 
Are there any visible morphological differences between the two haplotypes of E. atriventris? How can we display these lack of differences in a visually pleasing way?
