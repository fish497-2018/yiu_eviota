title: "Species boundaries in the *Eviota atriventris* species complex"
output: ioslides_presentation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#morphology data file for basic comparison analysis
morph <- read.csv("../data/cleaned_data.csv")
some_data <- read.csv("../data/morphology_numerical_data3.csv")
```

## What is a species?
- No one really knows 


## Physical barriers lead to isolation
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/goodfrey1996.png") 
```

- Pattern of surface currents in the indonesian islands 
- Isolation eventually leads to speciation
- Species boundaries in closely related species are often fuzzy
- It can be hard to distinguish closely related "cryptic" species 

## *Eviota atriventris* 
- The Blackbelly dwarf goby 
- A cryptobenthic reef fish
- Map (right) shows range throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific

```{r, out.width = "380px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/eviota1.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/rangemap.png")
```

## Plot twist
- some *E. atriventris* don't have a black belly
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/white_belly.png") 
```
Leads to the question 

- **Are they different species?**
- Look for evidence of differentiation by examining external morphology

## Pelvic fin morphology data
- contains individual ID no, sample locality, region (east or west), sex, pelvic fin characters
- some bad data columns
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(morph))
```

## Use tidyr to separate specimen identification information 
```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(separate(morph, Specimen, c("museum", "jar_no.", 
                                              "id."), sep = " ")))
```


## Comparing branch number between eastern and western populations
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="550px"}
ggplot(data = morph) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth= 0.5, mapping = aes(x = branches, fill = haplotype), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~haplotype) +
  xlab("No. branches on 4th pelvic ray") +
  theme_classic(base_family = 'Arial', base_size = 10)
```

- histograms show no difference between eastern and western morphs

## Taking subsets of data to run a t test 
- Compares number of branches on the 4th pelvic ray in eastern vs western groups
```{r, echo = TRUE}
west <- filter(morph, haplotype == "west")
east <- filter(morph, haplotype == "east")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, size = "1px"}
t.test(west$branches, east$branches)
```

## Taking subsets of data to run a t test 
- Compares number of branches on the 4th pelvic ray in eastern vs western groups
- An insignificant p value (>0.05) suggests no difference

## Analyzing all four pelvic characters at once 
- we will use a principal component analysis
- this loadings data for PC1 and PC2 will be used to make a plot
```{r, echo = FALSE}
traits <- some_data %>% 
  select(fifth_fourth_ratio, pelvic_ratio, fin_membrane, branches)

pca2 <- princomp(traits, cor=T)
loadings (pca2)
```

## PCA Plot
```{r, echo= FALSE}

# plot
plot(pca2$scores[,1], pca2$scores[,2],
     cex = 1.5, 
     col = ifelse(some_data$haplotype == 1, 'tomato', 'maroon4'), 
     pch=20, 
     xlab="PC 1", ylab="PC 2", xlim=c(-2.5,5), ylim= c(-2.5,3),
     cex.axis = 0.7,
     xaxs ="i", yaxs = "i", 
     pin=c(16, 9), 
     bty="l") #take away borders

legend(x="top", 
       cex=0.8, xpd = T , horiz=T, pch=c(20), 
       col=c("tomato", "maroon4"), 
       legend = c("Eastern, white-bellied morph", "Western, black-bellied morph"),
       bty = "n")

#western haplotype = 1 = maroon4
#eastern haplotype = 2 = tomato
```

- shows high overlap and no difference between groups

## Synthesis
- it is interesting that there is no morphological difference
- but there are genetic differences 
```{r, out.width = "700px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../pics/all.png") 
```

- It is hard to tell if they are separate species, since some evidence suggests separation but a taxonomist would use this morphological analysis to argue that they are the same
